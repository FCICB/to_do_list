To-Do List Application in C++
This is a simple console-based application that allows users to create and manage a to-do list. The application is implemented in C++ using the CLion IDE and uses file handling to allow the user to save and load their task list to and from a file.

Requirements
C++ compiler
CLion IDE
Usage
To run the application, open the project in the CLion IDE and build and run the project. This will start the application and display a menu of options. The user can choose from the following options:

The user can select an option by entering its corresponding number. The application will then prompt the user for any necessary input and perform the selected operation.
